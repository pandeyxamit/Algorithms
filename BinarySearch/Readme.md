# Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.
In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.


**NOTE**: Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.

### Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways:

- Iterative Method
- Recursive Method

## Time Complexities

- **Best case complexity**: `O(1)`
- **Average case complexity**: `O(log n)`
- **Worst case complexity**: `O(log n)`

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the binary search is `O(n)`.
